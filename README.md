The damage caused to the roads due to Natural calamities cannot be easily predicted. This phenomenon can be explained by accidents in its prone areas which can also be caused due to Smog blocking the vision of the commuters. This model can be used for the sole purpose to overcome this situation. This model can also be used to divert traffic caused due to congestion, blocking of roads etc. This model uses a sample of five poles which can cover an initial distance to indicate the alert .It can be implemented by using Arduino UNO, 7812 IC, Laser light Indicators, Siren and Zigbee. As normal LED indicator cannot display in bad weather conditions for that Laser light indicators can be used as it has better capability to display even in fog. Zigbee is used to establish wireless communication as it can be used to activate unauthorized access to the system.
